**1280. Students and Examinations**

Write an SQL query to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Table: **Students**

| Column Name  | Type    |
| ------------ | ------- |
| student_id   | int     |
| student_name | varchar |

The primary key for this table is `student_id`. Each row contains the ID and name of a student in the school.

Table: **Subjects**

| Column Name   | Type    |
| ------------- | ------- |
| subject_name  | varchar |

The primary key for this table is `subject_name`. Each row contains the name of a subject in the school.

Table: **Examinations**

| Column Name   | Type    |
| ------------- | ------- |
| student_id    | int     |
| subject_name  | varchar |

There is no primary key for this table, and it may contain duplicates. Each row indicates that a student with ID `student_id` attended the exam for the subject `subject_name`.

Return the result table with the columns `student_id`, `student_name`, `subject_name`, and `attended_exams`, ordered by `student_id` and `subject_name`.

**Example:**

Input: 
```

Output: 
```
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |

```

The result table displays the number of times each student attended each exam.

**Solution:**

*select s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name, count(e.student_id) as attended_exams
from students s
cross join subjects sub
left join examinations e on s.student_id = e.student_id and sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
group by s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name
order by s.student_id, sub.subject_name;*
