**197. Rising Temperature**

Write an SQL query to retrieve the Ids of all dates where the temperature is higher than the previous day.

Table: **Weather**

| Column Name  | Type   |
| ------------ | ------ |
| id           | int    |
| recordDate   | date   |
| temperature  | int    |

The primary key for this table is `id`. It stores information about the temperature on different days.

Return the result table with the column `id` containing the Ids of the dates where the temperature is higher than the previous day.

**Example:**

Input: 
```
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
```

Output: 
```
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
```

Explanation: 
On 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
On 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).

The query retrieves the Ids of dates where the temperature is higher than the temperature on the previous day.

**Solution:**

*select a.id from weather a, weather b where datediff(a.recordDate, b.recordDate) = 1 and a.temperature>b.temperature;*
