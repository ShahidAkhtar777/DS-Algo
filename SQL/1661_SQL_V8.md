**1661. Average Time of Process per Machine**

Write an SQL query to calculate the average time taken by each machine to complete a process in a factory website. 

Table: **Activity**

| Column Name   | Type   |
| ------------- | ------ |
| machine_id    | int    |
| process_id    | int    |
| activity_type | enum   |
| timestamp     | float  |

The primary key of this table is `(machine_id, process_id, activity_type)`. 

- `machine_id` represents the ID of a machine.
- `process_id` represents the ID of a process running on the machine with `machine_id`.
- `activity_type` is an ENUM of type ('start', 'end'), where 'start' indicates the start of a process and 'end' indicates the end of a process.
- `timestamp` represents the current time in seconds.

The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every `(machine_id, process_id)` pair.

Return the result table with the columns `machine_id` and `processing_time`, where `processing_time` represents the average time taken by each machine to complete a process (rounded to 3 decimal places).

**Example:**

Input:
```
Activity table:
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
```

Output:
```
+------------+-----------------+
| machine_id | processing_time |
+------------+-----------------+
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |
+------------+-----------------+
```

The table shows the user activities for a factory website. Each machine runs multiple processes. The query calculates the average time taken by each machine to complete a process based on the 'start' and 'end' timestamps.

**Solution 1:**

*select a.machine_id, round(avg(b.timestamp - a.timestamp),3) as processing_time from Activity a, Activity b where a.machine_id = b.machine_id and a.activity_type = 'start' and b.activity_type = 'end' group by machine_id;*

**Solution 2:**

*select a.machine_id, 
round(
    (select avg(a1.timestamp) from Activity a1 where a1.activity_type = 'end' and a1.machine_id = a.machine_id) - 
    (select avg(a1.timestamp) from Activity a1 where a1.activity_type = 'start' and a1.machine_id = a.machine_id)
,3) as processing_time
from Activity a
group by a.machine_id;*
